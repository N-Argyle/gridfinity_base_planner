# Gridfinity Base Unit Planner

[Available on Vercel](https://gridfinity-base-planner.vercel.app/)

A web-based tool for designing and visualizing custom Gridfinity base layouts. This application helps makers and organizers plan their Gridfinity storage solution's baseunit placement with an interactive 3D preview.

Uses a guillotine algorithm to create optimal placement of Gridfinity baseunits. 

Everything is client-side, SPA. No backend needed at the moment.
